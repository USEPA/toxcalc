<dd>
<p>There are many ways to express concentration such as Mass per unit volume (e.g. mg/L), Molar concentration (e.g. moles/L), Percent or parts per hundred (e.g. %), Parts per Million (ppm), parts per billion (ppb) and parts per trillion (ppt). When using parts per notation (like percent, ppm, ppb, ppt etc.), concentration can be expressed as the ratio of the mass, volume or mixed mass/volume of the two parts of the system. Common concentration ratios are weight/weight (w/w), volume/volume (v/v) and weight/volume (w/v).</p>
<p><b>1. Percent</b>: Percent or <i>Per cent</i> refers to the amount of one substance <i>per</i> 100 units of another.  In percent mixtures, the amount (expressed in weight or volume) of a substance is expressed as percentage of total mixture weight or volume. Percent solutions take three main forms:</p>
<p>(1) <span class="term">% weight/weight or %w/w:</span> (also called percent by mass or percent weight). This is used when the weight of both substances is used to prepare the mixture.</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="example">Example:</span> A solution of 30 g of sodium chloride and 70 g of water would be 30% sodium chloride by mass: [(30 g NaCl) ÷ (30 g NaCl + 70 g water)] × 100% = 30%.</li>
</ul>
<p>(2) <span class="term">% volume/volume or %v/v:</span> (also called percent by volume, percent volume).</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="example">Example:</span> A 70 mL %v/v solution of isopropyl alcohol in water contains 70 mL of isopropyl alcohol for every 100 mL of the total solution.
</ul>
<p>(3) <span class="term">% weight/volume or %w/v:</span> By far the most common unit for w/v solutions is grams per 100 mL. Since this is so commonly used, it may be helpful to commit this to memory.</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="example">Example:</span> A 5% solution of sucrose in water is 5 grams of sucrose in 100 mL of water. Note that in a w/v mixture, the units in the numerator and denominator are not the same, so this is not a true percentage since the ratio is not a dimensionless quantity. Because of the way it is defined, you can have a w/v % solution that is over 100%.
</ul>
<p>The formulas for calculating %w/w, %v/v and %w/w are given below. %w/w can be calculated using the following formula:</p>
<p sdKatex="\frac{\text{mass of the substance of interest}}{\text{total mass of the solution or mixture}} \times 100"></p>
<p>%v/v can be calculated using the following formula:</p>
<p sdKatex="\frac{\text{volume of the substance of interest}}{\text{total volume of the solution or mixture}} \times 100"></p>
<p>%w/v can be calculated using the following formula:</p>
<p sdKatex="\frac{\text{mass of the substance of interest (g)}}{\text{total volume of the mixture or solution (mL)}} \times 100"></p>
<p><i>Hint:</i> When entering study data from the source document it is important to check whether the substance of interest is reported in %w/w, %v/v and %w/v because this can have implications on the dose received. This may require some digging into the methods section of papers that describe how something was prepared, since it is not always explicitly stated.</p>
<p>Interconverting from dose and these % solutions is not always straightforward and requires knowledge of density, temperature, pressure as well as other considerations like partial molar properties (see example below for the complexities that can arise).</p>
<p>Example: Calculate the mg/kg body weight dose of 100 mL 40%v/v ethanol in water</p>
<p>A solution containing 40%v/v ethanol contains 40 mL of pure ethanol in a total volume of 100 mL. Since ethanol contracts in water, the amount of water required to bring the volume up to 100 mL at 20°C is not 60 mL, but rather 63.34 mL. Thus, this solution, while being 40%v/v ethanol is actually a 63.34%v/v water solution. Since ethanol is lighter than water (the density of pure ethanol is 0.7893 g/mL (at 20°C)), the mass of the ethanol in 100 mL of this solution is 31.572 g (40 mL × 0.789 g/mL = 31.572 g)<sup><a href="javascript:void(0);" data-html="true" data-toggle="tooltip" title="A 40%v/v ethanol solution is a 33.26%w/w ethanol solution. The weight of the water added to the ethanol is 63.34 g in 63.34 mL. Thus, by mass this is a 33.26%w/w ethanol solution (31.572 ÷ (31.572 g + 63.34 g) × 100 = 33.26w/w%">1</a></sup>.  If the intake rate of this solution is 100 mL per day, the daily dose of ethanol would be 31.572 g/day or 31.572 g/kg body weight/day for an animal weighing 1 kg.</p>
<p><b>2.  Parts per million (ppm):</b> Substances that are in lower amounts can be described in parts per million. Toxicologists often deal with substances in ppm or lower quantities. Substances in even lower amounts can be described in parts per billion (ppb), parts per trillion (ppt) and so on. Like percent which is essentially parts per hundred (with the exception of %w/v), ppm and other quantities are dimensionless and can be used for gases, liquids and solids. Also like percent, ppm, ppb and so on can be expressed in terms of mass, volume or mixed mass/volume units.</p>
<p>When dealing with weight units, such as the presence of a solid substance in another solid substance, one ppm is the same a 1 mg/kg, since 1 mg is 1 millionth of a kg (i.e. 1 mg is 1/1000<sup>th</sup> of a g and 1 g is 1/1000<sup>th</sup> of a kg, thus 1 mg is 1/1000 × 1/1000 or 1/1,000,000 of a kg). One ppm w/w is about equivalent to one granule of sugar in 273 sugar cubes. One ppm is also the same as 0.0001%w/w, since this is also 1 mg/kg. One ppb w/w is the same as 1 µg/kg and one ppt w/w is the same a 1 ng/kg.  Scientists usually express concentrations of substances present in low quantities in liquid media in ppmm/v or ppbm/v. Since the density of pure water is about 1 g/mL, 1 mg/kg in water is equivalent to 1 mg/L of water or 1 ppm. This density can be assumed for dilute aqueous solutions. To help visualize such small quantities, see <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/aa-m8a-jZ0k">this link</a>. The table below provides the relationship between percent, ppm, ppb, ppt and their weight and volume equivalents. When converting between ppm w/v in a liquid to mg/kg, the density of the liquid needs to be considered if it is not water or dilute aqueous.</p>

<p>Example: 20 mL of a 1200 ppm(v/v) glycerin solution in water was consumed. Convert into mg/kg body weight/day based on an assumed body weight of 60 kg.</p>
<p>While ppmV is not a common unit for liquids, it is occasionally used. This solution contains 1200 parts of glycerin in 1 million parts of the solvent, which in this case is water. Since this is stated to be a ppmV solution, one could assume for the purpose of illustration that it contains 1200 mL of glycerin in 1,000,000 mL of water. In this case, we need to find the total mass of glycerin in this solution. The density of the glycerin is 1.26 g/mL at standard temperature and pressure, so 1200 mL of glycerin will weigh more than if it was water (i.e. since water has a density of 1 g/mL, if we had 1200 mL of water it would weigh 1200 g) . However, since it is heavier than water, the concentration of glycerin in this solution would be 1200 mL × 1.26 g/mL or 1512 g in 1,000,000 mLs of water which is the same as 1512 mg in 1,000 mLs of water, or 1512 mg/L. Thus, 1200 ppm glycerin in water is equivalent to 1512.0 mg/L of glycerin in water. Note that this same principles applies for ppb, ppt etc, since these are dimensionless quantities that describe the relationship between two quantities. If 20 mL of this solution was consumed, the daily dose would be 30.24 mg/day ((1512 mg/L × 20) ÷ 1000 mL) = 30.24 mg/day. If body weight was 60 kg, this would be 30.24 ÷ 60 kg = 0.503 mg/kg body weight/day.</p>
<p>It is important to note that this is only true if mixing the 2 liquids are additive, which may not always be the case. If, as in the example with ethanol, volumes change by their mixing, this equation would not hold true. However, when one component of the mixture is present in the ppm, ppb or ppt range, the quantitative impact of these solution interactions will be smaller than in the % solution situation. Also, it is important to correct for the any changes to the solution caused by changes in temperature or pressure.</p>
<p>Example: Calculate the mg/kg body weight/day dose of 100 mL of a 10 ppm w/w solution of ciprofloxacin made up in glycerin. Assume a body weight of 60 kg.</p>
<p>10 ppm w/w = 10 mg of ciprofloxacin in 1,000 g of the solution by weight is the same as 10 mg per kg of the solution. The density of the entire solution is 1.26 g/mL at STP. If the solution had the same density of water, 100 mL of the solution would weigh 100 g and 100 mL would contain 1/10 of the ciprofloxacin, or 1 mg. However, since glycerin is heavier than water, 100 mL weighs 100 × 1.26 g/mL or 126 g. Thus, 100 mL of this solution will contain 1.26 mg of ciprofloxacin and the daily dose would be 1.26 mg/day. For a 60 kg body weight, this would be 1.26 ÷ 60 kg = 0.021 mg/kg body weight/day.</p>

<dt><a name="molarity">Molarity</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>The molarity of a solution is the number of moles of solute present in 1 L of the solution (mol/L). Other units include mmol/mL, µmol/µL and so on. Thus, 1 mol of sucrose (342 g) in a final volume of 1.0 L has a sucrose concentration of 1.00 mol/L or 1.0 M (1.00 Molar solutions).  The formula for molarity is:</p>
<p sdKatex="\text{Molarity} = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{Litres of solution}}"></p>
<p>Example: 250 µL of a 10 µM dexamethasone was injected intraperitoneally in a mouse. What is the mg/kg body weight dose?</p>
<p>Dexamethasone has a formula weight of 396.461 g/mol. A 1 M solution of dexamethasone would contain 396.461 g of dexamethasone in one liter. Therefore, a 10 µM solution of dexamethasone is 3.96461 mg/L. In 250 µL there would be 0.00099 mg or 0.99 µg. If the mouse weighed 30 g, injection of 0.99 µg result in a dose of 33 µg/kg body weight or 0.033 mg/kg body weight.</p>

<p>The molality of a solution is the number of moles of solute present in 1 kg of the solution (mol/kg). Other units include mmol/kg, µmol/kg and so on. Thus, 1 mol of sucrose (342 g) in 1 kg of solution has a sucrose concentration of 1.00 mol/kg or 1.0 M (1.00 Molal solutions).  The formula for molality is:</p>

</dd>
<dt><a name="mixture">Mixture</a></dt>
<dd>
  Combination of two or more substances in which each substance retains its own chemical identity and properties.  In general, mixtures have no fixed composition. The amount of one or more components (substances) can usually vary over a wide range. For example the amount of sugar in a cup of coffee can vary widely from a little to a lot. In the case of coffee, sugar and water are components of the mixture.
</dd>
<dt><a name="solution">Solution</a></dt>
<dd>
  A solution is a homogenous mixture of two or more substances. A cup of coffee is a solution in that the coffee and sugar are uniformly dissolved throughout the mixture.  In this case, the coffee and sugar are the substances which are dissolved in the water and are thus considered solutes. Generally, solutes are present in the lesser quantity. The water is the dissolving media, or the solvent. When both solute and solvent are present at 50% either component can be considered the solute or solvent.
