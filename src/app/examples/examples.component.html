  <h4>Examples</h4>
<u>Example #1</u>: Substance X has a NOEL of 100 mg/kg BW/day for a systemic effect when delivered via the oral route in an animal study. To arrive at the PDE for this substance, two modifying factors are applied: 10 for interindividual variability and 10 for interspecies extrapolation (10 × 10 = 100). This results in a PDE of 1 mg/kg BW/day (100 ÷ 100 = 1 mg/kg BW/day). In this case, the PDE is intended only for the oral route. Now, let's assume that a PDE for Substance X is also needed for the intravenous route. The % bioavailability for the intravenous route is taken as 100%. The % bioavailability via the critical study route (i.e. the oral study from which the NOEL of 100 mg/kg BW/day was obtained) is estimated to be between 5% and 40%. If the higher value for % bioavailability is used in the calculation (40%), the bioavailability correction factor (BCF) would be calculated as 100%/40% or 2.5. If the lower estimate of bioavailability of 5% were used, the BCF would be calculated as 100%/5% or 20. The composite modifying factors when 40% bioavailability is assumed is 250 (10<sub>(interindividual variability)</sub> × 10<sub>(interspecies extrapolation)</sub> × 2.5<sub>(BCF)</sub> = 250), while the composite modifying factor when 5% bioavailability is assumed is 2000 (10<sub>(interindividual variability)</sub> × 10<sub>(interspecies extrapolation)</sub> × 20<sub>(BCF)</sub> = 2000). Thus, the PDE when a composite factor of 250 is used is 0.4 mg/kg BW/day (100 ÷ 250 = 0.4). When a composite modifying factor of 2000 is used, the PDE is 0.05 mg/kg BW/day, or 8 times lower. Thus, the lower bioavailability estimate is the more conservative estimate.
